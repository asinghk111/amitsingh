My research focuses on solving complex flow reconstruction problems by leveraging realistic imaging models and machine learning techniques. Specializing in inverse problems, I work at the intersection of fluid mechanics and machine learning, particularly in computer vision, NIRF, and physics-informed machine learning. By integrating physical laws with data-driven methods, my work aims to push the boundaries of imaging and flow analysis, contributing to more accurate diagnostics and innovative solutions in experimental measurements.</p> <p>Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture.
