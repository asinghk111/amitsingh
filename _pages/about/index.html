<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>Hi, thanks for stopping by! üëè,</p> <p>I am a PhD student working in <a href="http://samgrauer.ca/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Grauer Lab</a> at <a href="https://www.me.psu.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Penn State</a>. I am interested in improving fluid mechanics and combustion diagnostic techniques through advanced Computational Imaging and tomography framework. My current research focuses on solving complex flow reconstruction problems by leveraging realistic imaging models and machine learning techniques. Specializing in inverse problems, I work at the intersection of fluid mechanics and machine learning, particularly in computer vision, NIRF, and physics-informed machine learning. By integrating physical laws with data-driven methods, my work aims to push the boundaries of imaging and flow analysis, contributing to more accurate diagnostics and innovative solutions in experimental measurements. Specifically, I am working on Chemiluminesce Tomography but making an effort towards expand my knowledge in Background Oriented Schlieren Tomography and PIV.</p> <p>Previously, I have worked on Rarefied Flow at <a href="https://home.iitk.ac.in/~rkm/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Non-equilibrium Flow Simulation (NFS) Laboratory</a> as part of my master‚Äôs thesis and hold bachelor and master degrees in Aerospace Engineering from the <a href="https://www.iitk.ac.in/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, India</a>. I have also worked on Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINN) and have exposure working in experimental facilities on High-speed flows and combustion.</p> <p>In my spare time, I prefer watching movies and reading books related to various cultures and Indian politics. I grew up in the northern part of India and am fluent in Hindi.</p> </body></html>
